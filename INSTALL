1. The Arduino Leonardo sketch

   Simply copy the contents of the "arduino" directory to your sketch folder.
   If you want to add a new keyboard layout, you will have to edit all three
   files.


2. The Raspberry Pi configuration

2.1  Copy the contents of the "beepi" folder to your BeePi file system. The
     directory structure starts from root. If you want to use a keyboard
     layout other than German (and this layout is already present), edit
     /etc/default/keyboard and change the value of the XKBLAYOUT variable
     to the file you need.

2.2  Install console tools

     $ sudo apt-get install console-tools

2.3  Enable the keyboard setup service
   
     $ sudo service keyboard-setup start

2.4  Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local to enable NumLock on all
     consoles:

     INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
     for tty in $INITTY; do
         setleds -D +num < $tty
     done

     A good place would be right after the check for
     /home/pi/host_fs/.system/booted (BeePi 1.0) or
     /h/.system/booted (BeePi >=1.1) respectively.
